## Description

This app creates an html file containing information about a team of employees, laid out in an easy-to-view format to keep track of and share this information. The file is created through the command line by the user responding to prompts to populate the data.

## Usage

The user should open their command line terminal and run the application. They will be prompted to provide information about the employees on their team. Once all the prompts are complete the user will be asked whether another employee should be added. Upon a response of yes, the prompts will repeat for the new employee. Upon a response of no, the html file will be created including all the provided information. Opening the html file in a browser will allow the user to see the information for viewing and/or sharing easily.
